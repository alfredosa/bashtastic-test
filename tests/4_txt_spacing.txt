When I gaze into myself, I see a deep abyss:


And from that abyss another gazes back at me.





Oh, how this gazes pierces my soul!


It cleaves my thoughts, it rends my dreams.





There, in that abyss, lies the riddle of my being,


The eternal dance of light and darkness entwined.





I am the tightrope walker, poised in the void,


Balancing between the worlds, both low and high.





I have tasted the bitter fruit of knowledge,


Yet still I thirst for the sweet nectar of wisdom.





Let my footsteps resound across the precipice,


As I descend into the depths, seeking redemption.





For in the depths, I find my truest self,


Embracing the chaos, embracing the unknown.





And when I emerge, reborn from the abyss,


I shall be Zarathustra, the prophet of the free.
